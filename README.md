# Simulation
Example application for the C++ lecture. Device Programming with Raspberry PI 5 and boost statecharts.

This example use cmake >= 3.20, G++ >= 13.2 and boost >= 1.84. For the device programming the actual C++ binding auf GPOID Library used.

All this components and programs must be installed to use the project. Maybe its necessary to edit the CmakeList.txt file to change paths to the libs.

This library is added as submodule in this project.
